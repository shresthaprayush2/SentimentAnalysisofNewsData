# SentimentAnalysisofNewsData
Welcome to the "Master Sentiment Analysis" project! 🎉 This repository offers a comprehensive guide to building a sentiment analysis model that classifies news headlines into "Good" or "Bad" categories. The project is designed to be a hands-on learning experience, demonstrating practical applications of various machine learning algorithms.
📚 What You'll Learn:

    Text Data Processing: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
    Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text into numerical features.
    Model Building: Implementing and comparing different machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.
    Model Evaluation: Measuring the performance of models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Applying Grid Search to optimize SVM and Random Forest models.
    Predictive Analysis: Using trained models to make predictions on new data.

🔍 Key Features:

    Data Cleaning: Handles noisy text data by removing URLs, special characters, and performing tokenization and stemming.
    Model Comparison: Evaluates models based on execution time, accuracy, precision, and recall.
    Pickle Integration: Saves trained models to disk for future use.
    Scalability: Provides insights into how model performance changes with dataset size.
